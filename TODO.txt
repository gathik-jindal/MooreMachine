1) in blocks.py we need to make blockID a required argument and plot a default argument.
2) In some place blockID is a required parameter and in some places its not, need to fix all this scrambling
3) in utilities.py we need to move the dumpvars into a new file or do something about it.
4) why is scopeDump and env not a private attribute in blocks?
5) have a strong urge to push blocks to new file, or atleast move everything else to new files.
6) why isn't pydig in its own file!
7) Remove __uniqueID because now blockID is a required parameter.
8) need to have custom error messages for the checkType utility function.
